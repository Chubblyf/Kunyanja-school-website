            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>Kunyanja Private School: established in 2007, is a prominent private educational institute based in Nkhata-Bay, Malawi. 
                We pride ourselves in providing an outstanding educational experience to students. Our strong reputation for academic 
                excellence is built through continuous delivery of high-quality education over a decade.</p>
            <p>Our story: All secondary education in Malawi is fee paying. 17 years ago, with no support or resources, three teachers, 
                <em>Sydney Simumba, Feston Singoyi and John Chaula</em> were teaching children in the crumbling rooms of a local mosque.</p>
            <p>Today, Kunyanja Private School thrives in a lovely area of Northern Malawi. Starting from a small room with a few children and benches, 
                it has grown to accommodate over 500 students on a site given by the community. The school's beautiful buildings were constructed by locals 
                with support from many individuals in the UK, including Masambiro. Despite facing tough daily challenges, the dedicated staff and students have made it a great place to learn. 
                Despite ongoing difficulties, the school continues to progress and improve.
            </p>
            <p>We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to thrive and succeed in their academic pursuits, thus we offers a comprehensive curriculum 
                that is best suited for each student. Moreover, our dedicated faculty and staff are committed to creating a nurturing and supportive environment 
                where students feel empowered to take risks and pursue their passions.</p>
            <p>The school bursary scheme: Kunyanja Private School, acknowledged as a non-profit in 2011 by the District Education Authority, is dedicated to providing 
                quality education to all children. Each year, more than 100 children receive financial support for their school fees through a bursary program. 
                This support is made possible by Masambiro in the UK. These students typically come from orphaned backgrounds or families with unstable incomes, 
                making it difficult to afford private school education.</p>
